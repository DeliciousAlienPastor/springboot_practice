# Getting started with Spring Boot
This is a small scale project to familiarise myself with the workings of Spring Boot and how to integrate it with an external database.
The database used here is PostgreSQL.

This application will demonstrate the use of simple API calls on the database to perfrom CRUD operations.

## Note for setting up postgresql
I am using Linux so the process of setting up the database may vary for other OS. Make sure to provide the correct user authentication
info in the `application.properties` file.
